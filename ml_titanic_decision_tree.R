# In the previous chapter you did all the slicing and dicing yourself to find subsets that have a higher chance of
# surviving. A decision tree automates will automate this process for you, and outputs a flowchart-like structure
# that is easy to interpret (you'll make one yourself in the next exercise).

# Conceptually, the decision tree algorithm starts with all the data at the root node and scans all the variables
# for the best one to split on. Once a variable is chosen, you do the split and go down one level (or one node) and
# repeat. The final nodes at the bottom of the decision tree are known as terminal nodes, and the majority vote of
# the observations in that bucket determine how to predict for new observations that end up in that terminal node.
